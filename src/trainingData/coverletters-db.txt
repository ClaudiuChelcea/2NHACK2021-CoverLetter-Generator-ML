My name is [Your Name] and I am applying for the position of [position name] with your company as advertised on [company website / Linkedin / job board website]. 

I have spent the past 8+ years doing number crunching and database management for a SAAS business, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of data analysis.

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work; the only thing cleaner than my room are my spreadsheets. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. (Manager’s Name),

I am interested in applying for the full time position as a Senior Office Clerk as posted on (Website). Enclosed is my resume for your reference.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Sociology in February of 2007. Since then, I’ve accrued seven years of administrative experience. During that time, I’ve gradually built a strong foundation of knowledge regarding the various tasks and duties required of an office clerk. For instance, I’m now deeply familiar with Microsoft Office and other office management software, and have developed a suite of efficiency tools to keep an office organized and on task.

Working as Head Office Clerk at Omega Corporations has prepared me to meet the challenges of a managerial role in a professional office environment. One example of how I exceeded expectations as an employee is when I simplified the process of data retrieval for my managers – saving the company $24,000 in annual labor costs. I was also responsible for supervising and training a staff of three regular clerks and four interns. I believe that, equipped with my proven managerial skills and cost cutting abilities, I can contribute effectively to your company and be a valuable employee.

Additionally, I worked at Land’s End Industries where I handled the payroll activities for 60+ employees, answered an average of 40 calls per day, and improved our customer service rating 15% by training employees in new service techniques. Throughout my tenure I was known for taking the initiative, embracing challenges, and overcoming obstacles.

I would be thrilled to have an opportunity to personally interview with you. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.  Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Name

Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

Ever since I was a child, I’ve loved transforming people through the art of makeup. My proudest accomplishment was preparing my younger sister for her prom night — she was voted prom queen that evening. Because of my passion for this artform, I’m applying for the makeup artist position at Studio 96.

I’ve worked in several customer service positions since I graduated high school, through which I’ve honed my people skills and improved my ability to work effectively in high-pressure situations. In fact, in my current position at Zara I’ve increased sales by 17% this month.

However, I’ve found that customer service doesn’t satisfy my creative side. Thus, I’m eager to join Studio 96, a company I’ve been a fan of since I learned about the avant-garde approach to makeup application developed under your founder Bianca Del Vanjie.

To meet Studio 96’s needs, I’ve completed the 150-hour course in Makeup Artistry offered by the Los Angeles-based Sonique Academy in my spare time. I’ve also volunteered for the Look Good, Feel Better organization, where I boosted the self-esteem of cancer patients by giving them makeovers.

I am looking forward to hearing back from you. I can be reached at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email]. Thank you for considering my application.

Dear Mr. Jacobson,
 
As a long-term admirer of the work done by the team at Mayflower Technologies, I’m delighted to submit my application for the entry-level IT technician position posted on Indeed.com. As a recent graduate from the University of Rochester with a B.S. in Computer Science, I’m confident that my knowledge of Linux systems, experience in backend coding, and precise attention to detail would make me an asset to the team at Mayflower. 

In my former role as a student worker at the University of Rochester’s Technical Services department, I was responsible for troubleshooting a variety of technical issues for staff, assisting with server maintenance, and installing a wide range of equipment. While employed there, I assisted in the development and rollout of new department practices, and helped improve our ticket response time by 12%. I’m sure that this experience will help me pick up new skills and quickly excel as a technician at Mayflower.

I also understand that Mayflower is seeking to expand their cloud computing services. While at the University of Rochester, I specialized in and completed my thesis on cloud computing. The IT technician position at Mayflower would be an exciting opportunity for me to bring my educational background to the table, and learn more about a growing industry.

As a quick-thinking online native who’s obsessed (yes, obsessed) with the Scatterplot app, I was thrilled to see your listing for the Social Media Manager position at Scatterplot Entertainment Co.

With over three years of professional experience as an online brand manager under my belt, I’ve analyzed user metrics, run A/B tests, tracked interaction data, and spearheaded viral social media campaigns. You name it, I’ve clocked an embarrassing number of hours online working on it. I’m confident my adaptability, hands-on branding experience, and encyclopedic meme knowledge would make me a perfect fit for the team at Scatterplot.

Currently, in my role at DotMap as a Social Media Manager, I manage and execute highly successful online branding campaigns. Over 8 months, I’ve bumped up our user engagement metrics on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and (let’s not forget) Snapchat by over 140% on average. Not only that, but I regularly produce viral content, getting several of our branded Tweets featured on major websites. In one such instance, I tweeted a thread of adorable corgis using the DotMap iOS app — receiving over 60 thousand interactions and earning a spot on Buzzfeed’s front page.

I’m fiercely competitive in my approach, up-to-date on all the latest trends, and can clean up even the messiest social media disasters. I’m positive my knack for creating clickable content will make me an immediate asset to the Social Media team at Scatterplot.

I look forward to discussing the Social Media Manager position and my qualifications with you in more detail. I’m available to talk at your soonest convenience, and I’ll be in touch next week to follow up, just to make sure you’ve received my application!

I’m writing to apply for the Restaurant Manager opening at MOD Sequel. I have more than five years of experience managing restaurants and bars, and my professional expertise aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined in your job advertisement.

In my role as Restaurant Manager for Bar Louie, I proved to be an efficient, enthusiastic, and strong leader. My value quickly became apparent to Bar Louie’s shareholders after I single-handedly trained and prepared the entire waitstaff for opening night and beyond. Not only did our team meet sales goals each month for the first year, but the down payment for the property was even paid back after the first six months of operating.

MOD Sequel would benefit from my skills in the following areas:

•	Eye for excellence and high level of standards

Dear Ms. Doe,

I was excited to see your job listing for the Senior Digital Marketing position at Westward Strategies on Indeed.com. As a dynamic email marketing specialist with over two years of professional experience executing market research, analyzing consumer data, and running A/B tests to drive successful marketing campaigns, I’m confident that I would be a valuable asset to the team at Westward.

Your job listing mentions a need for someone who is experienced in email segmentation and campaign development, both of which are areas I have extensive experience in. I’m currently employed at Marketed Inc., where I’ve honed my skills by running numerous successful email marketing campaigns. While employed here, I’ve spearheaded a digital promotion campaign for the company’s new line of sandals that successfully raised our total online engagement by an impressive 13% over the course of six months, contributing substantially to the department’s annual goals.

I’m confident that my proven track record of excellent work ethic, unparalleled attention to detail, and high-performing email marketing campaigns will make me an immediate asset at Westward Strategies, and allow me to contribute to the team’s success.

I look forward to discussing the Senior Digital Marketing position and my qualifications with you in more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up and to make sure you’ve received my application.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
